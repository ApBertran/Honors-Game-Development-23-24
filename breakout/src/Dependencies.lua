-- push is a library that will allow us to draw our game at a virtual
-- resolution, instead of however large our window is; used to provide
-- a more retro aesthetic

push = require 'lib/push'

-- the "Class" library we're using will allow us to represent anything in
-- our game as code, rather than keeping track of many disparate variables and
-- methods

Class = require 'lib/class'

-- a few global constants, centralized
require 'src/constants'

-- utility function file
require 'src/Util'

-- the rectangular entity the player controls
require 'src/Paddle'

-- the ball that travels around the screen destroying bricks
require 'src/Ball'

-- the bricks to collide with
require 'src/Brick'

-- powerups
require 'src/Powerup'

-- the class used to generate new levels/brick layouts
require 'src/LevelMaker'

-- a basic StateMachine class which will allow us to transition to and from
-- game states smoothly and avoid monolithic code in one file
require 'src/StateMachine'

-- each of the individual states our game can be in at once; each state has
-- its own update and render methods that can be called by our state machine
-- each frame, to avoid bulky code in main.lua
